# How to Execute the Tests **Configuration and Setup**
Install the JDK and configure Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE.
Include the JUnit and Selenium libraries in the build path for your project.
Make sure you have the browser driver installed and configured in your PATH, such as ChromeDriver.

Executing the Tests
You can download or clone the project files to your computer.
To begin the automation task, open the appropriate Java test class:

     -Task1WebSubmissionFrom.java
     -Task2RegistrationFromForUser.java
     -Task3DhakaStockExchangeScarpTable
- Use the terminal command or the IDE to run the test classes:

  

**Confirmation**

-Look for success or failure signals in the assertion logs for the online forms.

-Check the resulting text file (such as store.txt) and the terminal output for the table scraping.



**Output Documents**

- Logs: The console contains logs of test results and execution information.
- Text File: Scraped table data is stored in ```store.txt```.
